# Microfrontends application

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

- Author smaller, easier to understand codebases

- Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!

- Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users

- Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently

Fully developed with production-style workflow with a full CI/CD pipeline
- Deployed to Amazon Web Services with CloudFront https://d1axi7ymauml8.cloudfront.net/
- Isolated rules styling by applying CSS-scoping techniques
